# @microsoft/typescript-etw

**@microsoft/typescript-etw** is a native Node.js module for logging ETW events for the TypeScript project.

## Compatibility

ETW is a Windows technology, so this module only works on Windows (Win7 or later). The module is built using the N-API interface and works on Node.js 8.9 or later. (See https://nodejs.org/docs/v8.9.0/api/n-api.html)

## Installing

Install from npm via: `npm install @microsoft/typescript-etw`

Since this dependency only supports Windows, consider using the `--save-optional` flag to add this as an optional dependency or `--no-save` to omit this as a listed dependency altogether.

The module will build from source using node-gyp. Use the flag `--target_arch=ia32` or `--target_arch=x64` to target a specific architecture.

If you would like to take advantage of types for this package information, install them from DefinitelyTyped via: `npm install @types/microsoft__typescript-etw --save-dev`

This will allow you to compile your code with types even if the optional dependency was not installed.

## Usage

Be aware that calling `require` on this package may return `undefined` if it fails the compatibility checks in `index.js`. It may also throw an exception if it is an optional dependency that is not installed. This example shows a way to `require` this module that accounts for both cases:

```javascript
var etw;
try {
    etw = require('typescript-etw');
} catch (e) {
    // Optional package not found
    etw = undefined;
}
```

Then you can log events conditionally:

```javascript
if (etw) etw.logInfoEvent('message');
```
